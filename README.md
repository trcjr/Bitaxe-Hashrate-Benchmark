# **Bitaxe Hashrate Benchmark**

A Python-based benchmarking tool for optimizing Bitaxe mining performance by testing different voltage and frequency combinations while monitoring hashrate, temperature, and power efficiency.

## **Features**

* Automated benchmarking of different voltage/frequency combinations  
* Direct setting of specific voltage and frequency from command line
* Temperature monitoring and safety cutoffs  
* Power consumption monitoring and reporting (Watts)
* Fan speed monitoring and reporting (Percentage)  
* Power efficiency calculations (J/TH)  
* Automatic saving of benchmark results  
* Graceful shutdown with best settings retention  
* Docker support for easy deployment

## **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.11 or higher  
* Access to a Bitaxe miner on your network  
* Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)  
* Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## **Installation**

### **Standard Installation**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrv777/Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark.git  
   cd Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows  
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/Mac  
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:     
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Docker Installation**

1. Build the Docker image:  
   `docker build -t bitaxe-benchmark .`

## **Usage**

### **Standard Usage (Run Full Benchmark)**

Run the benchmark tool by providing your Bitaxe's IP address and initial settings:  
```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py <bitaxe_ip> -v <initial_voltage> -f <initial_frequency>
```

**Arguments:**

* `<bitaxe_ip>`: **Required.** IP address of your Bitaxe miner (e.g., `192.168.2.26`).  
* `-v, --voltage:` **Optional.** Initial voltage in mV for testing (default: `1150`).  
* `-f, --frequency:` **Optional.** Initial frequency in MHz for testing (default: `500`).

**Example:**  
```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py 192.168.1.136 -v 1150 -f 550
```

### **Apply Specific Settings (Without Benchmarking)**

To quickly apply specific voltage and frequency settings to your Bitaxe without running the full benchmark:  
```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py <bitaxe_ip> --set-values -v <desired_voltage_mv> -f <desired_frequency_mhz>
```

**Arguments:**

* `<bitaxe_ip>`: **Required.** IP address of your Bitaxe miner.  
* `-s, --set-values`: **Flag.** Activates this mode to only set values and exit.  
* `-v, --voltage`: **Required.** The exact voltage in mV to apply.  
* `-f, --frequency`: **Required.** The exact frequency in MHz to apply.

**Example:**  
```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py 192.168.1.136 --set-values -v 1150 -f 780
```

### **Docker Usage (Optional)**

Run the container with your Bitaxe's IP address (add --set-values for that mode).
Benchmark results are written to `/results` inside the container — use `-v` to mount a host directory so the results persist after the container exits:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/results:/results bitaxe-benchmark <bitaxe_ip> [options]
```

Example (Full Benchmark):
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/results:/results bitaxe-benchmark 192.168.2.26 -v 1200 -f 550
```

Example (Set Settings Only):
```bash
docker run --rm bitaxe-benchmark 192.168.2.26 --set-values -v 1150 -f 780
```

## **Configuration**

The script includes several configurable parameters. These can be adjusted in the UI or in the bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py file:

* Max Acceptable Error Percentage: 1%.
* Maximum chip temperature: 66°C  
* Maximum VR temperature: 86°C  
* Maximum allowed voltage: 1400mV  
* Minimum allowed voltage: 1000mV  
* Maximum allowed frequency: 1200MHz  
* Maximum power consumption: 30W  
* Minimum allowed frequency: 400MHz  
* Minimum input voltage: 4800mV  
* Maximum input voltage: 5500mV  
* Benchmark duration: 600 seconds (10 minutes per combination)  
* Sample interval: 15 seconds  
* Sleep time before benchmark: 90 seconds
* Minimum required samples: 7 (for valid data processing)  
* Voltage increment: 15mV  
* Frequency increment: 20MHz  
* ASIC Configuration: asic_count is hardcoded to 1 as it's not always provided by the API. small_core_count is fetched from the Bitaxe.

## **Output**

The benchmark results are saved to `bitaxe_benchmark_results_<ip_address>_<timestamp>.json`, containing:

* Complete test results for all combinations  
* Top 5 performing configurations ranked by hashrate  
* Top 5 most efficient configurations ranked by J/TH  
* For each configuration:  
   * Average hashrate (with outlier removal)  
   * Temperature readings (excluding initial warmup period)  
   * VR temperature readings (when available)  
   * Power efficiency metrics (J/TH)  
   * Average Power (Watts)
   * Average Fan Speed (Percentage or RPM, if available from API) 
   * Input voltage measurements  
   * Voltage/frequency combinations tested  
   * Error percentage (live and per test)
   * Error reason (if any) for a specific iteration

## **Safety Features**

* Automatic temperature monitoring with safety cutoff (66°C chip temp)  
* Voltage regulator (VR) temperature monitoring with safety cutoff (86°C)  
* Input voltage monitoring with minimum threshold (4800mV) and maximum threshold (5500mV)  
* Power consumption monitoring with safety cutoff (30W)  
* Temperature validation (must be above 5°C)  
* Graceful shutdown on interruption (Ctrl+C)  
* Automatic reset to best performing settings after benchmarking  
* Input validation for safe voltage and frequency ranges  
* Hashrate validation to ensure stability  
* Protection against invalid system data  
* Outlier removal from benchmark results

## **Benchmarking Process**

The tool follows this process:

1. Starts with user-specified or default voltage/frequency  
2. Tests each combination for 10 minutes  
3. Validates hashrate is within 6% of theoretical maximum  
4. Monitors error percentage live and flags tests as failed if error % exceeds the configured threshold  
4. Incrementally adjusts settings:  
   * Increases frequency if stable  
   * Increases voltage if unstable  
   * Stops at thermal or stability limits  
5. Records and ranks all successful configurations  
6. Automatically applies the best performing stable settings  
7. Restarts system after each test for stability  
8. Allows 90-second stabilization period between tests

## **Data Processing**

The tool implements several data processing techniques to ensure accurate results:

* Removes 3 highest and 3 lowest hashrate readings to eliminate outliers  
* Excludes first 6 temperature readings during warmup period  
* Validates hashrate is within 6% of theoretical maximum  
* Monitors error percentage live and flags tests as failed if error % exceeds the configured threshold  
* Averages power consumption across entire test period  
* Monitors VR temperature when available  
* Calculates efficiency in Joules per Terahash (J/TH)  
* Averages fan speed across entire test period
